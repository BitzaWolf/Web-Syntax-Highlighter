Add Pre-processor highlighting.
    This needs to be ignored for code without pre-prcoessors like Java.

Add more languages.
    This is just a simple thing:
    1) add two new global variables.
        $REGEX_<language here>_keywords
        $REGEX_<language here>_commands
    2) Store the list of the keywords and commands in these variables.
    3) Create a new function
        print<language here>CodeBlock($code)
    4) Have function call main function
        printCodeBlock($code, $REGEX_<language here>_keywords, $REGEX_<language here>_commands);

Highlight single-quote strings
    You'll have to modify the main function to add this. Probably just slightly modify the current REGEX for strings.
